I really like the idea behind this. I *do* wonder if its a bit kiddy. I would like to relate to computing 
more concretely in the first lesson.

Perhaps rather than the kind of silly I'm-a-robot game, you can print out a bunch of words one-to-a piece of paper, position
them on the board and have the kids give specific instructions for how to sort them in alphabetical order? 
I imagine the first pass through they would just tell you the order, put new words up, explain you want them to 
do this for *any* set of words. Tell them you're trying to get them to express the process in their heads, write their
instructions on the board (properly indented) as you go.
