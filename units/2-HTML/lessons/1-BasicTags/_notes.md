## GM 

I think this is a pretty obvious opportunity for my design-a-document-format game.

Pull up a web page the students are familiar with (I've used facebok in the past but thats not a great example 
- maybe their school's portal page?). Encourage kids to identify the areas of the page. Propose that they might want to write
someone a letter, and in it describe the page using words so that the content and strucutre of it could be recreated. Start
inventing on the board a structure that might work. Something like

```
Start Header
   Welcome to Jefferson High
End Header
Start Menu
   Sports (http://jeffhigh.com/sports)
   Curriculum (http://jeffhigh.com/curriculum)
   Prom (http://jeffhigh.com/events/prom)
End Menu
Start Content 
   See whats going on
   Start Photo Gallery
   End Photo Gallery
End Content
```

Point out some difficulties of this format. Together or in small groups see if students can modify the format to address these
* Amiguity around what is a tag versus what is text
*
