I think this is a pretty obvious opportunity for my design-a-document-format game. I think in order to do it, you need to explain why you're limited to text. Understanding that is easier if you know some history on the server-client nature of the internet. Therefore start with a lecture on the founding of the internet. Show a terminal, describe how at the time thats what computers looked like. 

* Each computer can find other computers through its IP address. Explain history
* Play IP address server/response game

Start with the [first page on the web](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). 

```
```

Pull up a web page the students are familiar with (I've used facebok in the past but thats not a great example 
- maybe their school's portal page?). Encourage kids to identify the areas of the page. Propose that they might want to write
someone a letter, and in it describe the page using words so that the content and strucutre of it could be recreated. Start
inventing on the board a structure that might work. Something like

```
Start Header
   Welcome to Jefferson High
End Header
Start Menu
   Sports (http://jeffhigh.com/sports)
   Curriculum (http://jeffhigh.com/curriculum)
   Prom (http://jeffhigh.com/events/prom)
End Menu
Start Content 
   See whats going on
   Start Photo Gallery
   End Photo Gallery
End Content
```

Point out some difficulties of this format. Together or in small groups see if students can modify the format to address these
* Amiguity around what is a tag versus what is text
*
